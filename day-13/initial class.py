#What is the for loop doing?
'''The for loop is printing 1 to 19.'''
#When the function meant to print "YOU got it!"
'''If the value of i will be 20 then it will print that but i will not be 20
because the value of i is taken under 1 to 19 inside for loop.'''
#What are your assumptions about the value of i ?
